Seminars, talks and more.
---

This repository has the purpose to register references, photos, questions,
and extra thoughts as part of the audience for different talks and seminars as well as 
references for speakers. Similarly, I will be collection thoughts on finding 
the formula for a great "scientific" talk which is well put by [Tanentzapf](http://www.tanentzapf-lab.com)
in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/TanentzapfLab/status/1184371699057188864):
> "I think that early on in one’s scientific career it's pretty important to read a lot of papers & go to lots of seminar talks. In particular I think it’s quite important to attend as many bad talks & read as many badly written papers as possible."
