# Seminars, talks and more.
This repository has the purpose to register references, photos, questions,
and extra thoughts as being part of the audience for different seminars and talks. 
Similarly, this repo is in a way aligned to the following comment on 
on finding the formula for a great "scientific" talk which is well put by 
[Tanentzapf](http://www.tanentzapf-lab.com)
in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/TanentzapfLab/status/1184371699057188864):
> "I think that early on in one’s scientific career it's pretty important to read a lot of papers & go to lots of seminar talks. In particular I think it’s quite important to attend as many bad talks & read as many badly written papers as possible."
