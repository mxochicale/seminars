Description
Join us to celebrate a special milestone for our new professors and hear about their inspiring career journeys.


## On the Importance of Basic Cell Biology of Unknown Translational Impact
Cell migration is essential for embryogenesis (when embryos develop from a fertilised egg cell) and plays a role in several pathologies such as cancer. However, much of our understanding of how cells move comes from analysing cell migration in a petri dish. Professor Brian Stamer's lecture will highlight the use of Drosophila embryonic macrophages, which can be live imaged at unprecedented resolution within developing organisms, to understand the mechanisms and functions of cell migration during embryogenesis. Hear more on the topic from Professor Stramer, who is based in the Randall Centre for Cell and Molecular Biophysics within the School of Basic & Medical Sciences.

## Food allergy: six approaches to a problem
Food allergy affects more than 5% of British children and is widely recognised as a major public health issue. When Professor Adam Fox (School of Life Course Sciences) began his career in allergy 16 years ago, this was far from the case. Back then, the provision of services and the treatment options available for them, were extremely limited and what was available was highly fragmented. Over the course of his career, Professor Fox has become involved in food allergy as a researcher, clinician, guideline developer, medical educator, through leadership roles and public engagement. This lecture will be a quick tour of successes and failures, and leave a chance to reflect on what the future holds for children with food allergies.
